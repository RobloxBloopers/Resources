Hey, please keep in mind that at the moment, this is actually a pain in the ass to use.
and it doesnt help the fact that I (Fanboy) didnt document this.

But at the same time, you would most likely have to download the animations and other shit.
And honestly I would just suggest AVOID using this, until I finally am able to hire someone
who can ACTUALLY code than I do.
